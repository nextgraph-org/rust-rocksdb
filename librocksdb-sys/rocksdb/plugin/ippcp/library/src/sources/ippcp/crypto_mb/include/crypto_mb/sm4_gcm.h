//   with full blocks (Blocks of 16 bytes size) or empty buffers and length of processed payload is not overflowed.
// * if functions at steps 2-4 called to process a partial block, it can’t be called again.
// * if mbx_sm4_gcm_update_aad_mb16 was called, mbx_sm4_gcm_update_iv_mb16 can’t be called.
